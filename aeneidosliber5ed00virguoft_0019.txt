JNTROD UCTJON. 15

This book is not so highly reputed as either of those between
which it comes: and the reason is not far to seek. There is

nothing, and there scarcely can be any tthLLn—the narrative of
sportS, which gives such scope to a poet like Vergil as the

tragedynfidisappmted loye' ln, Book IV„ and the vision of the
nether realms and all the future glories of μΒ-εζι-ιιῦθμιιιῂῶ BookQLL
Of the peculiar' quality of Vergil, the art by which quite simple
things said naturally of the actors and actions in his drama
seem to have a wider significance‚ and to touch deeper springs
of our nature, there is less in this book than the rest, if indeed
it appears at all¹.

There is, however, a great deal of fresh and vigorous de-
scription in the account of the contests, especially the boat-race
and the foot-race; the archery and boxing-matches naturally
lending themselves less to poetica] treatment than the sustained

excitement of a contest of speed. In this book, moreover, oc-

cur ῐὶιῗιᾶειεὲιέὲξ shgfflng the nearest approach to what one
may ca amour in the Aeneid3 namely, the picture (181) of the

ΙιῖΓῇΪὲζΠὲιΤοᾶ-εἶζῖἷῖιῖῗξ thrown overboard by his infuriated
master, landing wet and woe·begone on a rock and disgorging
the salt water he has swallowed3 and again the picture (3 57) of
Nisus piteously appealing to be remembered in the prize dis-
tribution, and all the while displaying ‘ a muddy face and mud-
bespattered limbs '.

A word must be said about the unfinished lines, 294, 322,

 

 

574, 653, 792, 815. It is well known as an old tradition, that
the poet was surprised by his last illness before he had had
time to revise the Aeneid to his satisfaction, and expressed a
wish that it should be burned. This story, precious as a proof
of Vergil's ideal standard of workinanship, is to some extent
borne out by indications of incomplete polish in parts of the
great poem, though less in the earlier than in the later books.

¹ Some approach to this quality is found in lines like 344, Gratior
et pulchro veniens z'n corpore virtus: in the description of the final
struggle of the racing boats, 229—231: and in the descent of sleep
at the end of the book.
