16 INTRODUCTIOJV.

And these unfinished lines are sometimes alleged as examples
of such incompleteness. Not much stress can however be laid
on this argument, as these lines occur in all the books of the
Aeneid‚ though not in the Georgics: and in some cases the
breaking off is rhetorically effective, and may have been inten-
tional. Thus 792 and 815 are, it may be urged, distinctly better
unfinished. Still it may reasonably be doubted whether the
poet would have left them, or left all of them, if he had had
time to complete the work.

Besides these there are two trifling inconsistencies (21, 865),
which are discussed in the notes. But whatever view be taken
of them no reasonable person could regard them as serious
blemishes.

The object of style in literature, apart from the subject-
matter, is to produce effect by successful choice of words,
Sometimes the effect is produced by using the simplest words
and phrases to express the idea: sometimes by the use of rare
or choice words, unusual turns of phrase, stretches of meaning,
or even stretches os grammar. The first we may call the
simple, the second the elaborate or artificial style. It is useless
to ask which is the best: each will suit best in turn the genius of
certain writers, the subject of certain poems, certain situations
or ideas, and the taste of certain readers: many poets will use
them both at different times: and both may be most effective
in the hand of a master. And each too has its danger: the
simple is liable to sall into bathos and commonplace: the ela-
borate has a tendency to become turgid‚ stilted‚ over-artificial. ·

Take as an instance of the simple style the well-known line
of Wordsworth 2—-

“Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.”

Or this from Milton's Claristmas Ode :—

“And kings sate still with awful eye,
As if they surely knew their sovran lord was by.”
