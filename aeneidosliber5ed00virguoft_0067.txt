No TES. 63

513. ‘his bow long ready, and his arrow stretched' tela, poetic use
of plural for singular, see δι.

517. A pretty imaginative touch: the poor bird's life is ‘lest in the
stars of heaven': the dead ssesh falls back to the cruel earth.

519. superabat, often in V. for ‘remained' supererat.

521. pater, added in a kind of apposition late in the sentence: V.
is fond of such added touches. So pater 130, virgo 610, mater vul. 370.

Observe e long of pater, the old quantity (as we see in πατήρ)· as-
sisted by the stress (arsis) of the foot-

N otice also artem arcumque, abstract and concrete, 484.

522-4. A very obscure passage. ‘Here a sudden wonder besel,
hereafter to be a mighty sign : the vast issue afterward taught them, and
awful seers sang their words of boding-—too late'. This looks as if it
meant a sudden wonder befel (the burning arrow) which boded ill, as
the event showed, and the seers warned them in vain’ but he entirely
omits to explain what the ‘evil soreboded' was.

Any number of guesses have been made, but they are only guesses:
Probably the tradition was one well-known to Vergil’s readers or
hearers.

5²3· augurio, dat. predicative ‘as an augury'.

526. tenuisque recessit consumpta in ventos, characteristically elabo-
rated expression ‘wasting faded thin into the air'.

527. refixa, ‘loosened’ a fine word.

528. crinemque volantia ducunt, ‘and trail their locks as they fly'.

crinis, an obvious metaphor for the trail of a shooting star: the word
comet means ‘hairy'.

529. haesere, ‘were aghast’.

530, nec...abnuil‚ ‘great Aeneas welcomed the sign’.

5 34. exsortem ducere honorem, best taken with Forb. Con. W. ‘that
thou should'st win a special honour ’‚ exsortem like ἐξαίρετον δώρημα
‘chosen out of the spoil before the lot-drawing': ducere as K. remarks is
rather an odd word: but perhaps, as prizes were so often animals, not
unnaturally extended to other prizes-

537. in magno munere, ‘as a noble gift’. the strange use ofin is
due to munere being used in an abstract way: just as we say ‘in honour’
‘in reward’ ‘in consideration'. So again, rather easier‚ tantarum in
munere laudum V111. 273.

Cisseus, a Thracian King, father of Hecuba wife of Priam.

538. ferre, epexegetic inf. 262.

54¹. praelato invidit honori, ‘grudge the preference’: strictly
speaking it was Acestes and not the honour which was praelatus, but
such a variation is quite Vergilian.

542. Observe the poetic use of quamvis with indic.

5 5²· proximus donis, ‘next in gifts' donis the common abl. of
res eet.

Ρ[(ἰ. takes it dat. but ingredior is always used with acc. eg. res
ingredior G 11. 17 5.]

[545 -603. Aeneas calls Ascanius and his comrades to display
cavalry inanoeuvres. The boys gaily dressed, in three troops enact
sham fights before their admiring parents. Their many movements
