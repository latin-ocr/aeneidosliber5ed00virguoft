62 VERGIL. AEN. V.

483. meliorem: it has been suggested that it was perhaps a custom,
when a victim was substituted sor another, to call it ‘a better lise' when
offering it to the god. It would be natural, to reconcile the god to the
substitution. And undoubtedly is the vigour of the victim was in point,
the prize ox was “a better lise’ than the battered Dares.

484. caestus artemque, V. is fond of such combination os abstract
and concrete. So ferro et arte vul. 2263 sedem et secreta, ib. 463,
artem arcumque, below 521.

[485—544. The archery. Hippocoon, Mnestheus, Eurytion, and
Acestes shoot at a bird tied to a mast. The first hits the mast, the
second cuts the string, the third pierces the bird. Acestes fires into the
air, but his arrow catches fire, a great omen. Aeneas welcomes the
sign and loads him with gifts, the others receive prizes in order of
desert.

486]. velint, 291.

487. Seresti, one of the companions of Aeneas.

488. traiecto in fune, ‘on a rope passed round her’ a variation sor
the more ordinary traiectum fune.

489. quo tendant, final, ‘a mark for the bolt‘.

490. sortem, ‘the lot’ used collectively.

492· primus exit locus, ‘first leaps out the lot of...’ locus, ‘the post
assigned '‚ and so the lot which assigns.

498. subsedit, ‘lay still'.

504. ‘And flew straight at the mast and piereed the shaft’.

arbor, an unusual word for the ‘mast', but very like Vergil.

505. We should say ‘fluttered in sear’. Vergil characteristically
says ‘sem-ed affrighted with her wings’.

507. adducto, ‘drawn home' the drawing hand close to his breast.

5 ιο. ‘knots and hempen band’ hendiadys, see 2 59.

511. ‘in which her soot entangled she hung from the tall mast ’.

pedem, acc. aster passive partic. on the principle explain 309. (This
is the passive form, like ἐπιτετραμμένος τὴν α’ρχην, not the middle form).
ln prose it would be innexo pede.

512. notos atque...in nubila ‘off to the south winds and the black
clouds '. This is sometimes called anastrophe of the preposition : where
there are two phrases conjoined the latter only having the prep. which
is therefore supposed to take efflet backwards.

The real fact is no doubt that originally the case expresses the relation
required generally, the prep. only defining it more specifically. Thus
in lIomer. we find ἢ ἁλὸς ἢ επὶ ’γῆςς and it is not right to say ἐπὶ governs
άλοςε ἁλὸς expresses the place where vaguely, ἐπὶ ’γῆς the place whereon.

This use once established, an artificial poet like Vergil will put the
first of two nouns without a preposition in cases where only the appear-
ance of the preposition with the second can justify it.

So ⁴ quas ego te terras et quanta per aequora vectum' νῐ. 692: you
could not say ‘quas terras vectum' alone.
