52 VERGJL. AEN. V.

179. madida fluens in veste, just as we say ‘dripping in his wet
garb ’: but in Latin the prep. is a variation of the ordinary phrase.

181. This book is a lighter interlude between the tragedy of lv.
and the solemn sublimity of Vl.; and we have here almost a touch of
humour. See Introduction, note on the fifth book.

¹84· Mnesthei, Greek dat.

s 185. capit ante locum, simply ‘draws ahead': lit. ‘gets position
irst’.

186. ‘Yet not his sull boat's length does he lead’. Notice the
emphatic ille, of which Vergil is rather fond: ‘Cainilla...non illa colo...
adsueta', vn. 805: ‘ille quidem hoc cupiens’, 1x. 796: ‘tam magis illa
fremens', vn. 787. See below 334, 457.

190. He calls thern ‘ comrades of Hector': the poet’s wont is to add
details incidentally to the story, and about this detail we know no more.

Troiae sorte suprema, an effective phrase, ‘in Troy's last hour'.

193· ‘The Ionian sea' washes Greece and the east coast of Italy and
Sicily. Malea is S. promontory os Laconia in the Peloponnese, famous for
storms. The third book relates how the Trojan fugitives first sailed to
Crete, then round Greece to Buthrotum, then across the Adriatic to Italy
and Sicily. The line refers to the earlier part of this voyage.

195· ‘Yet, obv—(if I only could), he means of course : such
breaking off short (aposiopesis) being very effective.

196. boc vincite, ‘win thus far': hoc is cognate accusative. [If hoc
had been meant to agree with nefas, V. would certainly have repeated
hoc instead of et.] .

199. subtrahiturque solum, ‘the watery floor slips under them ⁹, a
sorcible and happy expression.

202. animi may be gen. of respect, see 73: or more probably it is
an old locative like domi, cordi, and means simply ‘in soul'. It is used
not only with a large number of adj. but also with verbs (ango, crucio,
sallo, pendeo, Sec.) where gen. would be unlikely.

²03· spatio subit iniquo, ‘and nears a perilous course’, iniquo being
dat. [It also might be abl„ ‘and draws near on a perilous course’. V.
is fond of such varieties.]

'²05- The crash and crackling of the splintered wood is well given
in the sound.

207. morantur simply expresses that they are aground: the real
predicate of the clause is given in clamore. ‘The sailors fast aground
rise with loud shouts'.

211. agmine remorum celeri, ‘with swist beat of oar’, agmen being
a vivid word to describe the regularly moving line of oars. This suits
the common use, of an army: and the use V. 90 of a snake, as also
11. ἰη of Laocoon’s serpents. So of Tiber, 11. 782.

212. prona petit maria, ‘seeks the headlong seas’‚ i.e. ‘makes
straight sor the open water’ away from the rock, prona being transferred
epithet, describing really their movement along the sea„

[Others construe ‘sloping’ to the shore, which makes obscure and
iness‘ective sense, and is an unexampled use of the worth]

2¹4· nidi, ‘broo‹l', as osten.
