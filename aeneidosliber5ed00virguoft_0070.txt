66 VERGJL. AEN. V.

597. Alba Longa, the early community on the Alban hills. which,
according to tradition, was the sorerunner of the Roman state. It was
the seat of the Roman power aster Aeneas, acc. to Vergil.

601. patrium, because handed down from Aeneas onward.

honorem, ‘ observance’: having been originally in honour of Anchises:
the word is suitable enough.

602. pueri, the expression is unusual and Vergilian: he means to
say ‘Troy the sport is called, T rojan the troop', only instead of ‘sport’
he puts the boys who play it.

To put comma at nunc (as Forb. Wag. Goss. K.) spoils the run of
the line: makes the singular dicitur harsh: and destroys the emphasis
of Troianum.

603. hac-tenus, divided, as osten.

[604-699. Meanwhile Iuno sends Iris to urge the matrons to burn
the fleet. Pyrgo assures them it is no mortal woman who speaks: Iris
disappears on a rainbow. They then bring out fire and burn the ships,
but are quieted by Ascanius. The flames still continue, till Aeneas prays
Iuppiter to stay them, who sends a sudden storm and saves all the fleet
but four.]

604. fidem mutata novavit, a very artificial and unusual expression.

⁴ Here first Fortune shisted and sorsook her saith'. Perhaps the use
of novare with res in the sense of ‘disturb’, ‘overthrow’ may help us to
understand this usage.

605. ‘Pay to the tomb appointed rites'. tumulo being the dat. of
recipient where in prose one would have prep-

608. ‘Deeply plotting, her ancient wrath as yet unsated'.
saturata dolorem, probably the Greek constr. of object-acc. aster
asslve, see 30 .

p 609. mille9coloribus, abl. of quality or description: the order rather
bold and fresh.

610. virgo: for the position see 521.

613. secretae, ‘apart’, its proper meaning.

acta? Greek word ἀκτή [ἀγ- ‘break’‚ place where waves break]
‘beach .

615. ‘Alas‚ what many waters, what weary tracts of sea remain!'
the interjectional acc. ins. expresses emotion. Cf. ‘Mene incepto de-
sistere victam’, 1. 37.

618. lzaud ignara nocendi, ‘well skilled in working ill'. If, as C.
says, this phrase is suggested by the Homeric ὀλοφώια εἰδώς, it has not
quite the same meaning: the Homeric εἰδώς includes purpose.

620. Tmarii, adj. of Tmarus, mountain in Epirus near Dodona.
Is we have to account for her having joined Aeneas, we may remember
that he visited Helenus at Buthrotum, ΠΙ. 294.

Others read Ismarii from Ismaros, a Mt. in Thrace.

Beroe was a Trojan woman, 646.

621. fuissent, usually explained as causal ‘since she had had': but
Κ. seems right in explaining it as virtually oblique, expressing Iris’
thoughts: ‘Remembering how once she had had race and name and
sons .
