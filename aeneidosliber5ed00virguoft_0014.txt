Ottllz'ne of the Story.

According to Homer, Aeneas was son of Anchises and A-
phrodite (identified with the Roman Venus, goddess of love), and
the nephew of Priam king of Troy. At first he takes no part
in the Trojan war3 but being attacked by Achilles, afterwards
performs many heroic deeds for the Trojans. He escapes by
help of the gods when Troy is captured, and Homer clearly

conceives him as reigning at Troy after the departure of the
Greeks.

The later stories recount his wanderings about Europe after
the fall of Troy: and these Vergil adopts, making many altera-
tions and additions of his own. One great episode, his landing
at Carthage‚ and the love and desertion of Dido, we have no
means of tracing to any traditional source, and it may be
Vergil's own invention.

The Aeneid opens with the exiles leaving Sicily for Italy,
their goal almost in sight. A storm comes on and they are
cast ashore in Africa at Carthage. Here Dido entertains them,
and Aeneas in Books 11. and III. tells her of the sack of Troy
and how they have wandered since. In Book IV. we have the
love, desertion, despair and suicide of the Carthaginian queen,
as the Trojan exiles sail away from her harbour.

At this point the fifth book begins. As they sail, a storm

threatens, and they resolve to stop at Sicily, where the Trojan
Acestes welcomes them. Aeneas institutes a feast and games

in honour of his father Anchises. Then follow vivid and de—
tailed descriptions of a boat-racc, a foot-race, a boxing-match,
and an archery competition. After this Aeneas exhibits a new
shew, a cavalry gamo, or set of evolutions, performed by the
boys on horseback, and led by Ascanius. Meanwhile the malig-
nant Juno incites the matrons to burn the ships, a conflagration
