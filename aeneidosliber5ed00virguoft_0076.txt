72 VERGJL. AEN. V.

with transitive verbs as amant inter se, Cic. Att. 6, 1, inter se colent ac
dilzssgent, Am. 82, inter se aspiciebant, Cato, 111. 5.

noctemque diemque, some take as the ace. of duration: but ‘delay the
night and day with embraces’ is more poetical and imaginative.

768. numen, ‘its power too mighty to be borne' a somewhat
strange expression but not unlike Vergil. In any case the other reading
nomen is though easier, yet duller‚ and less like the poet: and it is less
well supported.

769,fugae, ‘exile‘ as opposed to the ‘home’ they had just found.

772. Eryci, this is of course the hero Eryx, mentioned 24.

773. ex ordine, ‘in order due': (as ex is used in ex animo, ex sen-
tentia, ex lege, ⁴ in accordance with ') : solvi stenem of course means that
the moorings are loosed.

774. caput evinctus, might be acc. of respect: but more probably
it is Vergil’s use of acc. of object after passive, see 309.

775-6. Slightly altered from 237.

777. Prosequitur, ‘escorts’ ‘attends’ thern.

[779—824. Venus complains that Juno’s persecution is too relent-
less: she begs Neptune to keep them sase on the sea. Neptune reminds
her how before he rescued Aeneas from Achilles: he will bring them
all safe to Avernus but one. He then flies off in his car over the
smoothening sea, and the sea-gods and nymphs attend him.]

779. exercita, ‘hai-assed’ ‘sore-distressed’.

783. quam, might be either ira or luno, but it is best taken of Iuno.

784. Observe the loose structure: the subject here is Iuno, though
quam is never changed to quae: it has to be understood.

785. ‘Tis not enough that from the midst of the Phrygian people she
has eaten out their city with her sell hatred, and dragged them through
every form of suffering’.

exedisse, unusually forcible metaphor: Trojans are a body out of
which the savage goddess has eaten the heart, and then proceeds to per-
secute the remains.

traxe, like vixti, dixti, vixet, &c.

788. sciat illa, ‘let her find out’—for none else can. In 1. 19,
Vergil himself gives us the reasons, namely, her jealousy sor Carthage,
and the judgment os Paris which pronounced Venus the sairest of the
gods.

'‘s9hois gldffb'ize itsrcildlsde at tigiiglihin book 1. 50—150. Juno stirred
up Aeolus (god of the winds) to let out the winds and make a storm,
just when the Trojan exiles were sailing from Sicily to Italy.

maria omnia, ἃς. the phrases again very forcible. ‘She confounded
all the seas and sky, she trusted vainly to the tempests of Aeolus, daring
this deed in thy kingdom'.

‘To mingle sea and sky’ is a hyperbole for ‘to raise a tempest’.
Venus speaks in an excited vein, to stir up Neptune to resentrnent: he
too had suffered (she says) from Iuno’s violence.

793. per scelus actis, ‘goaded to crime’ C.

794. subegrl, ‘has forced him’ Aeneas: or ‘them' the Trojans. She
mentions no name, but the sense is clear.
