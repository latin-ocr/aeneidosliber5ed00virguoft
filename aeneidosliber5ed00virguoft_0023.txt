lVote on the Imitations of Hbmer and others in Vergil.

To discover all the passages where Vergil echoes lines or
phrases of earlier ancient, and especially Greek, poets, would
be an endless task: but those places in this book which were
clearly suggested, more or less consciously, by Homer, will be
found collected in the Appendix at the end of the notes in the
form of a list drawn up by aid of the commentators.

Without discussing the question fully, which would not be
suitable in a brief edition like the present, a word on the question
of Vergil's imitations may be found useful.

The main point is that the modern idea of imitation is
entirely different from that which was held by the Roman
literary men, and which indeed could not fail ‘to be held by
them. With us, literary productions belong indeed mostly to
one or other main class, and so far are composed under condi-
tions which prescribe the form: though even here constantly new
varieties are invented : but both in style and subject-matter, the
aim of all great writers is to be original. The Roman literature
on the other hand was mainly formed on Greek models; and to
adhere to those models closely, to be constantly reminding the
readers of them, to imitate thern much in the treatment, in
the phraseology, and even in the incident, was inevitable to the
Latin poets; or, rather, it was one of the very things they pro-
posed to do in writing ¹. Vergil’s style, indeed, is completely his
own, and entirely unlike Homer's, as is plain from what has been
said; his main purpose and subject are entirely his own, and
truly Roman; he borrows where he does borrow (and that from
Ennius, Cyclic poets‚ Greek tragediam, and many others besides
Homer) always to suit his own purpose, and not in a servile
manner; and he invariably remains master of his materials‚ and
stamps his own mark indelibly upon thern.

But to understand Vergil, it is clearly necessary to grasp
the conditions under which he worked3 and nothing can be a
greater mistake than to feel surprise at the extent to which he
was indebted to his predecessors in the poetic art.
