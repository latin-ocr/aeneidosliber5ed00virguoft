NOTES. 51

143. tridentibus: the ‘beak’ (lower part of the prow) was often
divided into three points or peaks, one above another.

144. sqq. for the similes, see Presace.

146. nec sic immissis are the emphatic words containing the pre-
dicate, ‘nor borne so fast the teams whereon the drivers shake, &c.’

147. N otice the vivid bit of description pronique z'n verbera pendent,
‘leaning forward to lash them'.

149. inclusa litora, ‘the cliff-bound shores'. There are three stages,
the near trees, the cliffs of the shore, and the hills behind.

150. Observe the strange variation, ‘the hills struck with the eries
rebound’, when what he means of course is that ‘the eries re-echo from
the hills’. Vergil is very fond of such inversions.

151. primis elabitur undis, ‘skims the waves in front’, ‘slips out to
the front o’er the waves’, a compressed and expressive phrase, undis
being local abl. and primis really transferred epithet sor primus, so
common in V. with medius, primus, imus, and adj. of position.

153. pondere pinus tarda tenet, another Vergilian accumulated
phrase: ‘the weighty timbers check his speed' is what he means.

15 5. locum superare priorem, a stretch of meaning of superare, less
observable in English ‘to win the first place’.

1 57. iunctis frontibus, ‘with level beaks’.

In the rest of the line, having already emphasised the equalz'ty of the
two boats in the race, he varies the phrase, and says ‘and plough the
salt seas with their long keel’, i.e. the boats are neck and neck, and
their long keels parallel behind.

159. scopulo, the saxum of 124, which was the turning point or

metli62. quo tantum milzz' dexter abis? milti is the ethieal dative, or dat.

of person not directly affected by, but interested in, the action of the verb.
‘Prithee‚ why so far to the right?‘
163. stringat sine palmula, ‘let the blade graze’, indirect jussive,

stringat depending closely on sine.

166. quo diversus abis? ‘whither out of thy course?’

iterum is not part of the speech.

168. propiora tenentem, ‘nearer the rock': just the danger which
he feared. C. says propiora Gyae, which is a seebler repetition of

instantem terge.
1 70. radit iter laevom interior, a thoroughly Vergilian eompressed
but clear expression: ‘wears to the lest close in on the inner course’.

172. ossibus (local abL), conventional seat of deep or strong feeling.

174. socium, old form of gen. as in deum, virum, but rare in adj.

‘ F orgetful of his own honour and his comrades' safety’ simply means
that in pitching the pilot overboard he risked both the prize and the
boat. So ²²4 we find the ship beaten, quoniam spallam magistro est.

176. rector and magister, both predicateS, ‘himself the pilot he takes
thidlitiilae'alnicrlnggiitilgf. captain ’, magzster being the one who has general
gu 177. Strictly he would turn the tiller away from the shore when
steering close in: but this offers no difficulty in a poet.
