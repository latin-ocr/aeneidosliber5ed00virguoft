NOTES. 61

exit, ‘eludes': by the common stretch of usage, by which intransi-
tive verbs with some other case (here abl.) get a secondary transitive
meaning with acc. So excedo, dabor, evado, erumpo, enitor, διο. are
found with acc.

439. molibus, ‘engines'.

444. α vertice, ‘from above'. So of a wave i. 114 ‘ingens a ver-
tice pontus serit '.

446. ultro, a good example of the expressiveness of this word: here
it means ‘himself overborne ’ by the force of his mvn blow, not selled by
the other: quite in accordance with the proper meaning of the word
explained 55.

448. cava, ‘hollow’ and so weakened.

Erymantho, (abl. local.) a mountain of Arcadia.

449. Ida, the famous mount in the Troad.

451. it clamor caelo, ‘the shout rises to heaven;’ caelo, the poet.
dat. of the recipient, a common Vergilian variation for ad with acc. ε see
on 88.

456. ‘chases him all over the plain’: aequor, ‘the level' whether
land (as here) or as commonly the sea.

The abl. is the common local abl.

457. ille, grammatically superfluous, used with demonstrative em-
phasis ‘now behold! with his lest', see 186, 334.

13358. ‘thick as the hail wherewith the storm-clouds rattle on the
roo .

460. creber, obvious instance of transferred epithet.

pulsat, ‘belabours' ‘plies with blows’.

Dareta, the other Greek form instead of Daren 456.

463. eripffl't, ‘rescued'. .

465. ‘Seest thou not that here is another strength, and that the
god's favour is changed’ ? i.e. that Entellus is fighting with the gods on
his side, esp. Eryx his master. This seems the simplest way of taking

it, and suits cede deo, and the offering 483.
Observe non for nonneas often in poetry.

468. Notice Vergil’s relentless force in deseribing horrors: ‘drag-
ging his saint knees, lolling his head from side to side, spitting out gory
clots and teeth mingled with blood, &c.'. He has copied it no doubt
from Homer, but he has even added details: the most horrid of all
‘mixtosque in sanguine dentes’ is his own.

475. quaesuerz'nt, (subj. of indirect question) ‘what my strength
was’ you may Judge by what still it is.

offo. servetis revocatum. mere repetition ‘the rescued Dares you
reca .

479. libravit, ‘swung': properly .‘ to balance', then of the weighty
and balanced blow, by a not unnatural stretch.

480. ‘dashed (the thong) among the bones and shattered out the
brains‘. Again the forcible-horrible noticed on 468.

grotesque rhythm with the weighty common monosyllable bos at the end.
