INTROD UCTJON. 9

Aeneas, partly because the house of the Caesars, the gens Iulia,
traced back its origin to Iulus, son of Aeneas3 but principally
no doubt because it gave him so convenient an opportunity of
bringing before his countrymen‚ in a national dress, the glo-
rious poems of Homer. The battle pieces, the sea adventures,
the councils of the gods, the single combats‚ the royal feasts
and funerals, the splendid scenes and similes—all these things,
which charmed the educated Romans so much insthe Greek
epics, Vergil transplanted and naturalised in his own stately
and melodious verse. Moreover‚ by going back to Aeneas and
the tale of Troy, he raised the destinies of Rome to the old
heroic level in the imaginations of men. But however much of
Homer he may give to his readerS, he never forgets his main
purpose, to impress men with the dignity and greatness of
Rome, her significant history, her national unbroken life and
growth‚ and the divine protection which guided her fate.

One aspect of the poem was intimately connected both with
the Augustan revival and the poet's own nature: and that was
its profoundly religious character. To nothing did Augustus
pay more attention than to a revival of the national religion.
He rebuilt the temples, restored the worship, paid offerings to
the shrines, increased the priestly colleges, and took the office
permanently of Pontifex maximus. And the poet himself
viewed Rome as a state powerful by the protection of gods,
great in its ancient and elaborate ceremonial, and predestined
by the divine will to its career of Empire. Hence it is that
he is careful to weave into his narrative all manner of religious
references, allusions, and associations. Sacred places and cus-
toms are mentioned all through3 and the background of the
poem is the working of the gods themselves, with Fate ordain-
ing all.

Nor should we forget the antiquarian interest. The unity
of the race and the greatness of its destiny gave a high signifi-
cance to all old memories. Accordingly Vergil has collected
into his poem a mass of local traditions, old Latin customs,
explanations os names, and antiquarian lore of all kinds. He
feels that nothing can so stimulate the common patriotism, and
