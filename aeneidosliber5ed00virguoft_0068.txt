compaJred to the Labyrinth. The game still remains, called ludus Tro-
tanus.

the ughole gabnes ‘before the games were ended' i.e. before the company
was rsperse .

546. custodem, ‘guardian’, a servant who attended children.

547. Epytides, not mentioned elsewhere. The name is srom Homer
Il. xvn. 323, where he is herald of Anchises. The name means ‘son
of the loud-voiced one'.

549. cursus instruxit equorum (slightly unusual phraseology, as so
often in V.: instruere equitatum, being the prose phrase) ‘ has marshalled
the movements of his horse.

553. This equestrian exercise a kind of sham-fight on horseback,
was a Roman military sport for youths which Augustus had recently
revived at Rome. The description is not only graceful in itself, and a
pleasing contrast to the more serious sports which precede, especially
the gory boxing—match‚ but also was a well contrived compliment to
Augustus.

pariter, ‘in even line' (C.).

555. mirata, ‘admiring‘. Vergil uses thus the past participles of
the deponent verbs without any notion of pastnessin them, perhaps in
imitation of the Greek aorists: so per aequora vectis (G. 1, 206). cantu

Either Vergil uses coma pressa with strange looseness‚ meaning the
chaplet was over the helmet, (as vii. 751 fronde super galeam comptus),
and omits to mention the helmet (G. W. Ladewig): or, as the words
would incline one to think, he conceives them here without helmets, and
a hundred lines further has forgotten it. In any case it is impossible they
should have on both helmet and chaplet next the hair, (as Con. Ken.).

magistri (whose names he gives), and each troop divided into three
companies under three ductorem-¹.

562. agmine partito, ‘parted into 3’ he plainly means.

564. referens, ‘recalling’ the name: i.e. ‘called aster hirn’.
