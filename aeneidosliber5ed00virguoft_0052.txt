48 VER σα. AEN. V.

64. si...orbem, ‘ should the ninth dawn bring kindly day to mortals,
and with his beams unveil the world’, a varied and perhaps a modest
way of saying ‘when the ninth day comes‘. [Servius’ idea that it
means ‘if the day be fine' is not likely: almum is a standing epithet,
not a significant pyredicate, as mortalzbuys shews. ]

68—9. The simplest and most natural structure here is to make
aut answered by seu: ‘and he who bold of might either steps forth
more skilful with javelin and light arrows, or dares to engage, &c.’

69. crudus, properly ‘hardu (stem CRu-, whence crusta, cruor,
crudelis, crystallus), which is probably the meaning here. Or it may be

‘'‚raw the secondary sense, i e. untanned hide: but considering what
the caestus was, a hide thong weighted with lead, 'the other meaning
seems better.

71. ore favete Greek εὐφημεῖτε, the regular cry before a sacrifice or
celebration, properly ‘keep holy tongue', but practically meaning ‘keep
silence’.

[72—103. Aeneas with a large procession offers prayer and sacri-
fice at the tomb: a snake, perhaps the attendant os Anchises, appears
and licks up the libations: they then proceed to the banquet.]

72. materna, the myrtle was sacred to Venus.

73. Helymus, according to tradition a Trojan who had migrated
to Sicily, the supposed founder of the Sicilian tribe Elymi.

aevi, gen. of respect, a use which Vergil adopts widely and extends:
it is especially common with adjectives.

75. multis milibus, obvious poetic exaggeration, as when the
shrine of Apollo (VI. 43) has ‘a hundred broad passages': or a man
throws a stone (x. 128) ‘no small part of a mountain': or Allecto the
Fury ‘ has a thousand names' (Vll. 337).

77. mero Baccho, ‘ oswine unmixed' (with water). merus here an
adj. in its original use: we generally find subst. merum. The abl. is
descriptive.

The libations to the dead were of various liquids: we find wine,
milk, oil, water, blood, mentioned in various combinations. See 111.
66. Soph. Ο. C. 481.

80. salvete...cincres‚ ‘hail ashes rescued in vain’ must be the
meaning. C. objects that it is harsh, as it was not the ashes but the
live Anchises that was rescued, and proposes recepti gen. sing. But
the phrase is quite natural: and C.'s proposal is really much harsher.

81. ‘ Spirit and shade of my sire'. Observe the poetic plural.

82. non licuit, better not as question: it spoils the simple sadness
os the words: ‘it was not to be'.

83. Ausonius, one of the many poetic words for ‘ Latin’, ‘Italian '.
The Ausones were originally a tribe on the W. coast of S. Latium and
Cam ania.

qizicumque est, ‘'whate er it be'. With dramatic irony the hero
Aeneas is made to speak thus of the most famous river of all the world.

l 84. adyta, Greek word ἀί- δυτα, ‘not to be entered', i..e ‘holy
aee', ‘shrine'-
Ρ 85. Observe the accumulated expression, ‘a huge snake dragged
his seven coils in sevensold writhing'.
