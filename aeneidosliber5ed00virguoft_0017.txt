more characteristic specimens of the Vergilian simile. In (3)
the ‘dove has her home and sweet brood in the cavern’s chink';
very fit and pretty, but what has it do with the boat? Again,
when she is startled she begins by loud flapping and fluttering,
till she gains the free air, when she sails away. Now this is pecu-
liarly inappropriate to Mnestheus, whose course is unimpedcd
from tlte first, whereas it might have suited Sergestus, who got
in among the reefs. Again in (8) he gives a good description
of the Labyrinth‚ and ends with describing the confusion of the
winding ways, and speaks of a ‘maze baffling the seeker, without
clue or hope of return⁷: an effective line but quite irrelevant to
the Troianus ludus, where all the troops perform the same evolu-
tions, and there is no baffling.

So again even in (4) which is the most original of all these
similes, and in some ways the most vivid, the details still are
irrelevant: the wounded boat is in many ways admirably likened
to a wounded snake, but there is nothing to correspond to
‘gleaming eyes', ‘ hissing neck ', nor ‘knotted and writhing
spires'.

.Thus in the Vergilian simile, for the most part the details
are worked out independently, and while they relieve and adorn
the epic narrative, the comparison usually turns on but one or
two points and those commonplace.

This is what we may call the primitive use of the simile, as
it is employed in Homer, and imitated in many poets since.
There is however a modern use of the simile which is quite
different. If we open Shelley we read

“ The golden gates of Sleep unbar
Where strength and beauty, met together,
Kindle their image like a star
In a sea os glassy weather.''

Here there is nothing obvious in the comparison: we should
never have thought, without the aid of the poet’s superb imagi-
nation, of comparing the union of love to a star mirrored in the
smooth sea: and yet there is a profound appropriateness, not
only in the image, but in all the suggestions of it: the beauty,
