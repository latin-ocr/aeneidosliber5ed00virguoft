NOTES.

[1—34. Aeneas is sailing steadily seaward, when a storm threatens
from the west, and they put into the harbour of Eryx in Sicily.]

1. interea, while Dido was dying, as related in the last book.

2. certus, ‘steadfast’, in his character as the hero with a fate:
though behind him was the buming corpse of his deserted love, and
before hjm the waves ‘ black with the north wind’. So lv. 554 he was
‘ certus eundi .

Aquilone: as his course was north, from Africa to Sicily, the wind
was adverse. See note on 21.

3. Elissa, another name of Dido.

5—7. ‘The bitter grief of deep love stained, and the thought
what womap’s frenzy may do, draw the Trojan hearts through sad
sorebodin .

The eigrzression is tolerably clear though not quite accurate: the
grief is Dido's grief, and it is the thought of this which makes the
Trojans anxious.

Observe notum used as a nominative abstract subject. [The use is
found in Livy and Tacitus, ‘Observatum id antiquitus non terruit
Galbam'‚ Tac. H. Ι. 18; ‘diu non perlitatum tenuerat dictatorem’, Liv.
VII. 8: see Roby, Lat. Gr. 1411.]

polluere, properly por-luere, ‘to wash over'‚ so ‘to splash' or ‘de-
file’, osten used metaphorically‚ as of hospitium 111. 61, pax vn. 467.

8. pelagus, ‘the open sea’, as usual.

9. occurrit, ‘is in sight'.

10. olli, old form of illi. Vergil is fond of this and other archa-
isms: see Introduction, page 9.

caeruleus imber, ‘dark storm-cloud’‚ with Vergil's slight strain of

hrase.
p 1 1. inhorruit unda tenebris, ‘the wave shuddered with the gloom',
an imaginative way of describing the roughening effect of the squall.

13. quianam, another archaic expression, see 10. The meaning is
‘why?’ quia being simply neut. plur. of quis, so that quia-nam=quid-
nam: nam is enclific, used like ποτέ or δή in Greek, or ‘now '‚ ‘then'
in English aster questions.

¹4· deinde, ‘then‘‚ continuing narrative, would naturally come
first: but it has a way of getting transposed. So: quae deinde agitet
fortuna fateri, 111. 609.
