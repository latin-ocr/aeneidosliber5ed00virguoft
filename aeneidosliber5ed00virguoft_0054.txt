50 VERGJL. AEN. V.

remige (like milite) is naturally used in the instrumental abl.

1 17. Memmius, a Latin form of Mnestheus, as memini os μέμνημαι.
The derivation is clearly sancisul.

118. Chimaera, a monster, described in Homer as ‘Before, a lion:
behind, a snake: in the midst‚ a goat, breathing out the dread might of
glowing tire', Iliad VI. 181.

119. urbis opus, an idiomatic phrase, ‘huge as a city’‚ ‘a floating
cit .

ytrzssici versu, ‘triple tier', versus being a ‘line’ of oars. Vergil here
describes of course the well-known trireme, though (as often happens in
his descriptions) it does not belong to the heroic times.

120. terno, 85.

121. Sergia, a patrieian gens distinguished in the early history of
Rome, several os them having risen to the consulship. The fact that the
notorious Catiline came from this family does not hinder the poet from

giving thern the honour of a place here.
122. Centaurus, the well-known fabled monster, hals-man, half-horse.

Scylla, the six-headed barking sea-monster, mentioned in the Odys-
sey. Vergil imagines several of them, in the rocks of Messina, vx. 286.
12 3. Cluenti, the only one of this family about whom much is known

is the disreputable person whom Cicero defended.

[124—285. The boat-race. They start, Gyas first, Cloanthus second,
Mnestheus and Sergestus behind. At the rock Cloanthus passes Gyas,
who in a rage throws overboard his pilot. Mnestheus and Sergestus
race to pass him, but Sergestus sailing too close grounds on the rock,
and disables his boat. Cloanthus comes in first by aid of prayer,
Mnestheus second, Gyas third. Aeneas distributes the prizes. Last
of all comes in Sergestus with his wreck, and receives his prize.]

124. contra, ‘facing'.

¹²5· olim, ‘osttimes’. The word is strictly locative of olle or ille,
and means ‘at that time ', ‘then’; hence its use of past, present, or future.

126. Cori, the north-west.
127-8. ‘In calm it lies peaceful, and from the still sea rises a
meadow, the sunny haunt os sea-fowl'. The line subtly suggesting the

calm beauty of the scene described.
Notice apricis, transferred epithet, properly applied to the place,

then to the sowi who haunt it.
¹3¹· scirent, final subjunctive, ‘that they might know thence to

return’, i.e. might know that was the turning-point.

136. intentaque bracchia remis, ‘their arms are strained to the oar’
(i.e. they sit with their arms well sorward and the oar well back to get
a quick and good stroke at starting). Then he continues intenti expec-
tant signum, ‘a-strain they wait the signal ’, the strain this time being
mental, and the change from one to the other quite in Vergil’s manner.

137-8. ‘The beat of sear tugs at their bounding heart, and ‘eager
lust os same‘: the intensity and emphasis of the phrase to suit the inten-

sity of the suspense, again very characteristic of V.
¹4¹· versa, ‘u1)tu1·11ed’, from verto: certainly not verro as has been

suggested.
