NOTES. 55

nixanlem, alii nexantem, but the first gives really the stronger and
more emphatic sense, is more likely to have been corrupted, and is rather
better supported. nexantem would have been rather too near plz'canlem
in sense.

281 is not a meaningless repetition, for the sense is ‘Yet sails she
tries, and with sails she succeeds. The emphatic position of vela, velis
is quite right, as opposed to the futile nngzQum

282. promzsso, the promise apparently being that all who tried
should receive something. Servatam ob navem laetus however looks
as if Aeneas might have naturally refused the prize to the wrecked boat,
but relented in his favour.

284. operum Illinervae, weaving, spinning, and embroidery. Ob-
serve datur with -ur long by the sti-ess of the foot coming on it (arsis).

285. Cressa, ‘a Cretan'. genus, aec. respect.

[286—361. The foot-race. They start: Nisus and Euryalus, Diores,
Salius, Patron, Helymus, Panopes. Nisus first, Salius second, Euryalus
third. Nisus slips in some blood, and falls, but trip s Salius, and wins
the prize for his friend. Aeneas consoles Salius, and Nisus also. ]

286. mz',sso ‘’,over mitto often in poetry for omi-tto

288. theatri czrcus, ‘the round of a theatre’. V. after his manner
uses the well known and significant words in a slightly unusual con-
nexron.

289. quo se...tulz't, ⁴ thither the prince repaired with many thousands
attending, to the midst of the seats‘. consessu, abl. of place closely
with medium, a variation for in consessum medium: the word might
mean ‘the seated throng’, but if so here would be anticipatory, as they
were only,b croing to the seats: so the sense given is more likely. N otlce
that metitum is proleptic describing the result of tulzt.

[Others make consessu dat„ a rather harsher structure with the same
sense.

293). exstructo,‘ on a raised throne’ , abl. of place again. The word
originally part. is used as subst.

291. velzssnt subj. due to consecutive (or to use a more precise word,
gener ic) sense ol* qui, ‘any who may wish' ‚ ‘'whosoe er wishes’.

293. Szcant, note on 24.

294. For these broken lines see Introduction, note on book v.

296. amore pzo ‘fair love' (Μ). the word suggests the deep and
pure love of close kindred, though these are only comrades.

299. Tegeaeae, of Tegea', city of Arcadia' in centra] Peloponnese.

300. Helymus, 73. The other names are most probably adopted
by V. out of the earlier poets, though he is apparently osten free in his
handling of the traditions.

Trinacrzi, ‘Sicilian' from Trinacria a name of Sicily, lit. ‘three
cornered'· probably really a corruption of old Homeric word Θρινακίη
with which the island was identified.

302. fama obscura recondit, ‘whom rumour dim doth hide’ (M).
Observe the sels-contradiction of the phrase for the sake of epigranimatic
effect (oxymoron). Their fame was obscurity.

306. Cnosia, ‘Cretan' from Cnosus, old town near the N. coast of
Crete. The modern Candia is not far from the site of Cnosus.
