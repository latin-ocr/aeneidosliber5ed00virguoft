70 VERGIL. AEN V.

then tells him ot his coming visit to the shades below, where the future
should be revealed to him.]

720. Notice the emphasis laid on tum vero by its being deserred
till after the participle. Comm. quote similar uses ‘Confecto praelio
tum vero' ‘quo repulso tum vero' from Sallust and Livy: but this is a
much stronger instance.

‘F ired by such words of his aged friend, then indeed he was torn by
all distracting thoughts '.

animo, is the easiest and best supported reading: but animum may*
be right, prob. acc. respect.

722. ‘How did he come down from heaven, if he was in Elysium
below’? ask the comm. It is enough to answer that the vision was
sent by Iuppiter, ‘Imperio Iovis huc venz'o’.

728. pulcherrima, the variety of transferring the adj. into the rela-
tive clause is just in Vergil's manner.

730. gens dura atque aspera cultu, ‘hardy race and rude of life':
but the word aspera suggests the absence of cultus, so that it is a kind
of subtle oxymoron, see 40.

731. Notice Latio Vergilian abl. of place, where in prose a prep.
would be required.

Ditis, gen. of Dis, god of the lower world, the Greek Pluto (Πλού-
των); the name in both cases seems to be connected with the word sor
wealtlz, probably because gold and silver being dug up from the earth
seemed to be gifts of the Nether God. >

Ditis tamen ante. This rhythm, almost prohibited in the earlier
books, becomes much commonet in the later manner of the poet. In
Book X. there are several instances of it.

732. Averna, properly the lake and grove and cavern near the N.
end of the bay of Naples, where there was supposed to be a way down
to Hades: see next book. From this it came naturally to mean the
lower world itself.

734. tristesve umbrae, (a better reading than the more supported
tristes umbrae, a harsh apposition) might be only another phrase for
Tartara; but it probably refers to the regions mentioned vi. 426—540,
which are neither Tartara nor Elysium, but are the abode of children,
heroes, lovers, innocent suicides, &c-

amoena piorum concilia, ‘sweet gatherings of the good', another
name for Elysium the abode of the blessed. h

735. Sz'lzylla, the Cumaean prophetess whom he visits in her cave,
VI. 42, aud who shews him the way to Hades. [Notice the hiatus...colo.
Huc...aster the stop.]

736. nz'gy’arum. See note ou 97.

737. quae dentur moenia, ‘what city is destined sor thee': i.e. he
should hear all about the future Romans and the future Rome. The
promise is sulfiHed, VI. 756.

738. torquet, is probably Vergilian sor ‘speeding‘.

739. ‘1 scel the cruel breath of the Dawn’s panting steeds' a fine
line. The superstition of spirits ssying at the approach of dawn seems
universal.

741. proripz's‚ the acc. is easily understood in this excited style.
