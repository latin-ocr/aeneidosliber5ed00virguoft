No TES. 57

is now doubtful ', a very harsh and obscure construction. The Homeric
parallel which C. quotes to support his view, τῷ κέν μιν παρέλασσ’, οὐδ’
ἀμφήριστον ἔθηκεν, seems to me to make for the other int. , as it merely
suggests to Vergil the antithesis between a clear victory and a dead
heat,· which antithesis he has worked in, with a variation as usuah]

Observe the vivid use of the primary subjunctive, as if it were a
condition still realisable: i.e. as if the race were being now run before
our eyes. So xx. 912, continuo ineant pugnas, nz' Phoebus tinguat
e uos...'

q 327. Observe finis fem.‚ a late use: cf. la fin in French.

3²9· ut forte, not ‘where'‚ but ‘as it chanced that’, a loose use of·
ut giving the circumstances: Vergil is fond of this. Cf. VII. 509 ut sorte
scindebat, XII. 270 ut forte constiterant, XII. 488 uti forte gerebat. So
below line 588 and especially 667, where the true nature of this ut is
shewn by the following sz'c.

330. jusus, the blood, of course.

332. ‘Kept not his stumbling step as he trod the place’‚ phrase
1eelitborated in V.'s manner: titubata and lzaud tenuit two stages of the
a 1.

Observe the passive titubata; Verg. is rather given to the use of
intrans. participles passive, as though from transitive verbs: probably
an archaism. '

333. sacro, being victim's blood.

334. ille, 186.

3 36. arena, by a stretch for ‘soil': perhaps, as Wag. Con. say, the
suggestion is of the circus.

337. emicat, ‘ darts forth', expressive word. Observe -us long in
arsis before vowel.

339. Notice the characteristic variation of phrase, ‘Diores is the
third rize'.

3415). ora prima patrum, another Vergilianisrn for ‘the gazing
sires in the front'.

342. reddi poscit, common poetical stretch of construction for the
prose ut redderetur.

344. A beautiful line: ‘And valour lovelier to view in so fair a
form'. Notice Vergil’s sure poetic touch in the bold· word veniens, as
though the strength and beauty offered itself for approval.

345. proclamat, ‘calls aloud’.

346. subiit palmae, ‘has reached the prize‘, unusual words after
the poet’s manner.

347. reddantur, ordinary conditional subjunctive: the sense is
‘has won the meed in vain, should the first place be given to Salius’.
The indicative in apodosis is perfectly natural, owing to the sense,
which is a little compressed. If expanded into the strict conditional
form it would be: ‘he has won the meed, and his winning would be
vain, if the first place &c.' Such formal irregularities of the conditional
sentence, due to rapidity of style or substitution of something else for
the proper apodosis, are vcry common, e.g. memini numeros si verba
tenerem Ecl. 9. 45, multa. me dehortantur ni studium superet Sall. J.
31, and below 355 merui...nz' tulisset.
