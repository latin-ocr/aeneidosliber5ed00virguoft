74 VERGJL. AEN. V.

821. sternitur aequor aquis, ‘the swelling plain of waters is
smoothed'. aquis, ‘in its waters’, variation for aquarum, like telis
volatile fernam, virgulta sonantia lauro &c.

822. cete, Greek form κη’τη plural of κῆτος, ‘monsters'.

823. All the names that follow are sea-gods or sea-nymphs.
Glaucus occurs G. 1. 437. Palaemon, son of Ino, otherwise called
Melicertes, leapt into the sea with his mother and they became sea-
gods, Ov. Fast. vr. 486 sqq. Phorcus ¹240. leetz‘s, the mother of
Ac illes.

[827—871. The god Sleep comes down to Palinurus, and after
vainly trying to persuade him to rest, charmed him with a lethean
branch, and broke off the stern, and dropped tiller and helmsman into
the sea. Aeneas himself guides the ship‚ lamenting his pilot.]

827. ‘Soothing joy in its turn steals over his anxious heart’, in
Vergil's compressed effective style.

829. intendi bracchia velis, ‘the sails to be set on the yards'‚ the
characteristic variation (for vela bracchiis), just as with circumdare,
induere and other verbs. See 403.

830. ficere pedem, ‘worked the sheet’, evidently a nautical expres-
sion. (pes, the Greek πούς) was the name of the ropes fastened to the
bottom ends of the sail, to keep it in the desired position, the other
ends of the ropes being made fast to the aft part of the boat.

pariterque δια, ⁴ and together, now lest, now right, they loosen the
swelling canvass’, which would be the result ficere pedem.

832. cornua, ‘ horns’, are the ends of the square yards: their
‘ shifting to and fro' is also part of the operation of sail-setting.
sua, ‘favouring'z the breezes ‘suitable to⁷ the fleet.

833. Palinnms was Aeneas' own helmsman: the rest are ‘to

slliapf theirdpourse by him’ (ad hunc, lit. ‘towards him ', a natural use
o t e wor .

835. mediam metam, ‘the central goal’, is of course the centre
simply: the word perhaps suggested (as C. says) by the double race
course, where the meta was the post in the centre round which they
had to go. (C.’s own int. that meta is the ‘apex of the cone’ and so
the top of the sky, is less suitable.)

841. insonti: Palinurus is an innocent victim, fated to die for all,
to appease Venus’ wrath apparently, 815.

842· Phorbanti. Phorbas is one of the numerous names V. bor-
rPoavlvislgg? the Iliad. He introduces him here simply as a friend of

844. ‘ Steady the breezes breathe: ’tis the hour for rest': the very
line, with Vergil's subtle art, has a peaceful slumbering sound, as
indeed has all this passage.

845. ‘Rob thy weary eyes from toil', an artificialism quite in
Vergil's manner: the natural idea is to steal rest: and Vergil has
Υθῆῖἓῗωῗιῗ tdicitsive of the person robbed, as usual in Latin: and V.
habitually extends this dat. to things.
