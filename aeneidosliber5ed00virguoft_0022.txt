18 INTRODUCTJON.

plain thing in a plain way¹.' He arrests attention by the

vigour, the strangeness‚ the intensity, the emphasis, if I may so
ι phrase it, of his language. He is often stretching constructions
ι or the sense of words, using abstract sor concrete, part sor the
‚ Ι whole, adjective for adverb; transferring epithets, varying, in-
* 1¹ verting‚ seeking the unusual instead of the ordinary phrase.
= In short he is constantly surprz'sing the reader.

The good side of these peculiarities is sreshness and force:
the bad side is affectation. The protections ag nst affectation
are os course the poet's own taste‚ command of expression, ear
for melody, dignity, imagination‚ and skill3 and all these
qualities Vergil possesses in a consummate degree.

The following are a few of the instances in this book which

exhibit these peculiarities :

pugnam lacesso (429).

tempus agi res (638).

incensas perfert naves (665).

alternos orbibus orbes impediunt (584).
consessu medium (289).

pictas abiete puppes (662).

and these words :—

arena ‘earth' (336).
laude ‘merit' (355).
gloria ‘ambition’ (394).
arbor ‘ mast' (504).

Others the reader wilt find by referring to the Index of
Style at the end ε and there is much more of the same kind that
he can discover sor himself. Vergil's workmanship is so careful
and so perfect, that he is an inexhaustible field for the literary
analyst.

¹ I quote this sentence froin ‘Suggestions introductory to the study
os the Aeneid' by Prof. Nettleship; a paniphlet which all students os
Vergil wiu find most instructive, interesting and suggestive, as indeed is
to bc expected of so distinguished a scholar.
