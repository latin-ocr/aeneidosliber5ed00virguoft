NOTES. 75

847. vix attollem, i.c. he scarcely looks off his work: he keeps his
eye fixed on his course.

850. fallacibus auris must be dative after credam, and not ablative
with deceptus ; otherwise credam has no dative, and quid enim is awk-
wardly last in the sentence. That being so what is et?

The fact probably is that (as osten happens in V.) the construction
has become obscured by elaboration. The thought is: ‘ why should I
trust Aeneas to the deceitsul breezes and tlze deceitful sea ?' The last
four words are however further elaborated into the line before us, 851.

Construe: ‘Why should Ι trust Aeneas to the treacherous winds,
and the sky whose false promise has so often fooled me ?’

8 52. aafixus et haerens nusquam amittebat, emphatic triple repeti-
tion, ‘rooted and clinging to the tiller he loosed not his hold'.

8 5 3. nusquam, merely a Vergilian variation for nunquam.

sub, ‘lifted to’.

854. Letlze (λήθη, ‘ forgetfulness’) was the river of forgetfulness ‘in
a secluded vale’ of Hades (VI. 705), whose waters the spirits drank
before they emerged on earth for a new life.

8 5 5. Stygia. Styx being one of the rivers of Tartarus, Stygius
naturally means ‘ deadly’.

8 56. cunctantique natantia lumina solvit, one of V.'s terse expres-
sive phrases: cunctanti describes his ineffectual resistance, natantia the
flickering failing sight, solvit the end of the tension and effort under the
flood of sleep. (So when Cerberus is drugged terga resolvit Vl. 422.)

‘And spite of his struggles steeped his swimming eyes'.

858. The poop of an ancient vessel was high and curved, and the
top of it might be broken off without endangering the rest of the vessel.

859. gubernaclum, ‘the rudder', was a broad oar, of which there
were generally two, one on each side with the cross pieces joined toge-
ther (‘tiller’).

861. ales. Sleep is beautifully called ‘ winged', the suggestion
perhaps coming from the lovely Greek sculpture of the winged head of
of Sleep. So VI. 702, ΙΙ. 794, volucri somno.

862. non setius, ‘ none the less', spite of the loss of its rector: it is
under divine protection.

863. promissis, 813. Notice the pretty personifying touch inter-
rita.

864. adea, enclitic to demonstratives often, z's adeo, nunc adeo.
tuque adeo, &c. The Sirens, according to Homer, were two (Σειρή-
νοιϊν, Od. XII. 52) devouring maidens who charmed sailors with their
song and then ate them.

Homer’s geography is no doubt fancisul: but the Roman poets
seem to have placed them in three small rocks in the S. of the bay of
Naples‚ between Sorrento and Capri.

86 5. quondam. Vergil seems to forget that Aeneas (like Odys-
seus) belongs to the heroic age. Compare Ι. 109.

866. N otice the hissing line to describe the dashing seething sea.

‘Afar the loud rocks sounded with ceaseless surge'.
867. fluitantem errare, ‘was drifting astray’.
