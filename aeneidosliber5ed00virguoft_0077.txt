have been in ignota terra.

796. quod superest, ‘ what remains', i.e. ‘the remnant' of the fleet
or of the voyage, for it may be either: perhaps the first is the more
hkeigiiilfei‘hvilialtlciieiei'tezggs‘to spread safe sails to thee over the waves’:
i. e. to sail safely under thy protection : the tibi is the dative depending
on vela tuta dare.

797. Laurentem, ‘ Latin’‚ from Laurentum, ancient Latin town on
the sea, capital of king Latinus.

798. ‘If what I ask is lawful, if the Fates allow me there to build'.
ea moenia rather to be construed by the sense, as no walls have been
mentioned: but ca clearly refers to Thybrim, which suggests Rome.

799. Saturnius, sor Iuppiter, Neptune, and Dis, were all Saturn’s
sons.
801. unde genus ducis, how Aphrodite sprang from the foam was
well known in the Greek stories.

803. ‘1 call Xanthus and Simois to witness', the rivers of the
Troad. In the Iliad (book xx) it is related how Aeneas and Achilles
challenge each other to fight, and Aeneas being hard pressed is rescued
by Poseidon (Neptunus) who throws a cloud over him and his pursuer:
in the next book (XXI.) the two rivers rise against Achilles and he is
nearly beaten by them.

f 805. ‘ Chasing the coward host, dashed them against the walls', a
orcible line.

808. Pelides, Achilles, son of Peleus: dat. aster congressum.

802. nec dis nec viribus aequis, ‘ill-matched in strength and aid
divine .

810. cum cuperem, ‘though I wished ', concessive use os cum.

811. Laomedon, king of Trojans, had Poseidon to serve him sor a
time: he agreed that for a price Poseidon should build the walls of the
city: when they were built Laomedon refused the price, which explains
periurae. Cf. Hor. od. 111. 3. 21, ‘ ex quo destituit deos mercede
pacta Laomedon'.

813. quos optas: strictly she had asked for safe arrival at T z'ber:
but as they had to stop at Cumae (near Avernus lake, see 732) before
reaching the Tiber, this is substituted.

814. quaeres is best supported reading, and really makes best
sense ; ‘One only will you miss’‚ he says: sor Venus was afraid of losing
all her ‘remnant’.

The ‘ one only’ is Palinurus, who is drowned while steering, 860.

815. laeta, the result of the soothing: proleptz‘c use of adj., 25 5.

817. auro may be taken ‘with gold’ (the yoke) or ‘to gold' (the
chariot). Con. seems right in preferring the former, especially eonsi-
dering the connection of z'ungo and iugum.

818. feris, ‘the beasts', not necessarily of wz'ld beasts: so VII. 489
