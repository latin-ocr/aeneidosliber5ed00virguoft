62 3. ‘Ah hapless ones, for that no Grecian hand in war dragged you
to death’. quas...traxerit‚ causal subj.

626. vertitur, simply ‘is passing’: the word suggesting the circle of
the seasons.

627. cum...serimur, notice this special use of cum: ‘the seventh
summer since we bave been wandering', the English requires us to say:
the cum in Latin has a vague extended reference to all tlte time, and the
present ferimur is like the use of the present with iam dudum.

628. emensae, ‘having traversed ἐ the sidera used by a figure which
is natural enough for ‘regions'.

6 30. iacere, ‘to heap', used of agger, or moles, tumulus, and suggests
ra id buildin .

Ρ633. ‘Sigall ne’er again the name of Trojan walls be heard?' di-
centur, Vergilian refinement for ‘be ’, ‘be built’.

636. Cassandra, daughter of Priamus king of Troy, a prophetess
inspired by Apollo but disbelieved, dci iussu non unquam credita Teucris,
11. 247.

638. tempus agi res, ‘’tis time sor action': It is common to use the
active inf. after tempus, and this is a stretch (by analogy) of that con-
struction.

abl. of circumstances.

quattuor arae, raised by the four captains (115), says Servius.

642. connixa coruscat, ‘with huge effort brandishes': see 264.

645. nutrix, ‘the nurse', or strictly speaking the wet nurse, a person
of much more position and importance than a mere attendant. So
VII. 1, Aeneas buries his nutrix with solemnity and honour at Caieta.

646. Rhoeteum, a promontory of Troad, N. of Troy: the adj. is one
of the numerous words sor ‘Trojan'.

648. ‘What a proud mien and glance, what tone, what inajesty of
gait‘. So Horace, S. 11. 3. 311. ‘Spiritum et incessum'.

worn out metaphors.

variation of structure: instead of saying ‘of painted pine' he says
‘painted with '‚ or ‘in respect of pine‘. Compare sopitas ignibus aras,
