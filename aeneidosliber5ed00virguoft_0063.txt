ΝΟ TE S. 59

370. (Paris, son οἱ Priam, the seducer of Helen and cause of
the Trojan war.)

372. Ι have followed C. in putting no comma at corpore: the pride
was of birth and bulk combined: moreover se ferre is not exactly
‘boasting', but rather ‘displaying oneself', and is more appropriate to
obvious visible qualities like size and strength. ‘ Stalked to the field a
giant huge, os the Asian blood of Amycus'.

Butes, not known.

Amycus, king of the Bithynian tribe the Bebryces ; whose fight with
Pollux is related in a well-known idyll of Theocritus (XXII).

380. alacris, a varied form for alacer, which V. does not use. So
vx. 685, ‘alacris palmas utrasque tetendit’.

excedere palma, ‘were yielding the prize', slightly stretched use of
words but meaning obvious.

384. quae finis standi (observe finis fem. cf. 327), ‘ what end shall
be of standing here', i.e. how long must I wait?

385. ore fremebant, ‘shouted applause’: for the Trojan thus walked
over the course.

387. gravis castzjgat, variation (as often) for adv. gram‘ter, ‘chides
hardl ’.

Elztcllus, another Vergilian personage not appearing elsewhere.

388. ut...c0nsederat‚ ‘seated as he was ’‚ exactly as 329.
389. ‘ Once bravest, and for nought’, if you don't challenge him.

391. nobis, the ethical dat.‚ which points the scorn os the question,
⁸ where shall we find that god thy master Eryx, so idly vauntedP’

Eryx 24: the word deus loosely but naturally applied to Venus’ son.

394. gloria, by a stretch of usage for ‘ ambition‘.

395. sed enim, ‘ but indeed ’‚ an older use of enim as an emphatic
or demonstrative particle, like Greek ἀλλὰ γάρ. So 1. 19, 11. 164.

gelidus...tardante...hebet..frigent...effi’tae, a good example of Ver-
gil’s accumulation of phrase.

397. improbus iste, ‘yon unseemly boaster'.

iste always refers to person addressed, ‘that you speak of', 'that by
you‘, δια, so here, addressing Acestes, he says ‘ Your unseemly one’,
i.e. ‘the one you urge me to fight’.

3198. si fhret, ‘had 1 now had’. The regular meaning of impf.
con 1t. 5¹·

401. caestus, a strip of hide, tanned or raw, wound round the
hand and weighted with iron or lead (405): a deadly kind of boxing-
glove, to increase the force of the blows.

403. intendere, prop. ‘to stretch on’; so vincula collo intendunt
(11. 2 36) is an example of the regular and original construction: then by
a very natural extension the verb becomes transitive to the other object
(just as circumdo is used with manus collo or manibus collum) and
means ‘to bind'; so locum senis intendere, (‘surround’‚) [v. 506. So
also innecto palmas armis, 425.

terga, ‘hide’, as above.

406. longeque recusat, ⁸ shrinks back afar'. recusat a good instance
of the way V. employs the unusual word.
