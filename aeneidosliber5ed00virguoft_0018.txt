the isolation from others, the reflection of the brilhance, the
infinity, the serenity. Or again,

“ Life like a dome of many-coloured glass
Slaz‘ns tlte white radz'ance os Eternily
Unlz'l Death tramples z't to fragments.'’

Here too the comparison is not at all obvious: it is fetched from
sar by the poet's deeper insight and quieker sensibility: and it
is splendidly illustrative all through: the bright colours com·
pared with the pure white light resemble the chequered shifting
imperfect beauties of life compared with the changeless per-
fection of eternity: the narrow limited dorne and the endless
vault of heaven give another equally deep contrast: and lastly‚
the perishable glass contrasted with the eternal spaces of the
universe.

The more such similes are studied, the richer light is thrown
on the comparison: they are not, like Vergil’s, poetic miniature
pictures to be enjoyed independently3 they are prosound lu-
minous resemblances, a permanent addition to our fancy and
insight‚ for which we are grateful to the higher gifts of the
poet.

I have said so much, to make it clear, that what Vergil aims
at in his similes is something quite different (and in one sense
far less) than what the modern poet (especially the lyric poet)
aspires to: for in order to appreciate the true poetic success of
Vergil, it is clearly necessary to understand his object, and so
avoid the mistake of judging him by an erroneous standard.

Note on tlte ffi'ftk Book.

The fifth book occupies an exceptional position in the
Aeneid. It comes, as a relies and a contrast‚ between the high-
wrought tragedy of Dido's death in the fourth book, and the
beautiful and majestic poetry of the meeting with Anchises, and
the prophecy of Rome, in the sixth. It adds not a little to the
variety and artistic character of the whole conception, that be-
tween two such elevated passages should intervene the light,
fresh, and sometimes almost humorous account of the games.
