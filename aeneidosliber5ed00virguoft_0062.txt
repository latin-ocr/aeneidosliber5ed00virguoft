58 VERGJL. AEN V.

[C. and W. treat reddantur as due to orat. obliq. which is inferior
sense and very unlikely grammar, as the principal verb venit is indica-
tive. Others read reddentur and redduntur, plainly alterations]

350. me liceat, ‘let me be suffered’ (jussive). Observe the acc. ins.
aster liceat, in place of ordinary dative.

351. tergum i‚nmane ‘monstrous hide', inmanis neg. os old adj.
manis, ⁸,good kind’, (whence the euphemism ‘the good' lllanes sor the
Βερῗῑεᾶ Spirits‚ ) originally ‘horribless s’avage, hence ‘huge,

m1 t .

ἓαιζαίί, ‘African’‚ 51.

352. villi, ‘shaggy hair’.

3 5 5. laude, rather a strange Vergilian stretch for ‘ merit’.

Observe merui...ni tulisset on the principle explained 347. merui,
‘1 have earned' implies habuissem or some such word, ‘ 1 should have
won .

357. Observe again here the approach to humour noticed in 181.
Nisus woe-begone pleading for a prize with a muddy sace, is an object
only suited to this lighter book.

358. olli: for the form, see 10. The case is unusual, Vergil em-
ploying the constr. of irrideo, as rideo-takes acc. ι

3651950Ϊὲ ²:321? ‹gssrarilnugl’xglggvttg ggnlglgeputgiffazraset-Say ‘ the workman-
ship’; compare for plural nidi, ²¹4·

360. The line must mean ‘ rest by the Greeks from Neptune's
sacred portal ‘, as K. W. &c. take it, Danais being dative of the agent,
not unfrequently used after passive participle in imitation of the Greek:
e.g. nz'lzz'l tibi relictum, VI. 509: milti iuncta manus, V111. 169.

Ilow the shield was recovered from the Greeks by Aeneas before
Troy, Verg. does not say.

[362-484. The boxing bout. Dares, a great Trojan boxer, alone
offers, and after a pause claims the prize. Acestes urges the aged
boxer Entellus to compete, who reluctantly agrees, and challenges
Dares. Dares eluding a blow, Entellus falls heavily, and exasperated
thereby beats Dares all over the field. Aeneas stops the fight. En-
tellus slays with a blow the prize ox to Eryx his hero-patron.]

363. praesens might mean simply ‘ready', ‘present'‚ in its ori-
ginal and common sense: but Vergil so osten uses it to mean ‘ active',
⁸ powerful’, of gods, and semidivine personages, that this is probably
the real suggestion of the word, even when used of the boxers: ‘ who-
c‘er has valour and strong spirit in his breast’. Cf. praesenti marte,
vul. 495, and especially, si quid praesentius audes, XII. 15²·

366. velatum auro vittisque, ‘clad with gold and fillets’3 he does
not say how the gold was put on: the common way was to gild the
horns, and if he means this the phrase is rather obscure and strained.

Observe the alliteration os the v's: Vergil is especially fond of this.

368. vastis rum viribus effi·rt ora, ‘ with his huge strength appears':
not sor vastis viribus instr. abl„ sor the meaning is not ‘he comcs forth
mightily' but ‘he comes sorth mighty', ‘ huge bulk and a11’‚ which the
cum is required to express.
