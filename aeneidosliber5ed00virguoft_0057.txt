NOTES. 53

²¹5· fertur in arva volans, ‘flies to the field ’‚ as C. says a general
description of what she does, after which follows the detailed description
which contains the parallel.

Notice the sound- imitation all through· the checked fluttering in
plausum.. .ingentem‚ and the liquid smoothness of what follows.

216. tecto, local abl. without prep. common in V., ‘in the cav’.e

218. ipsa, i. e. ‘of her own accord’.

ultima aequora, ‘the finish' of the course.

220. ‘Struggling on the high rock and' in the shallows’ is a phrase
expressive enough, though m scopulo alto perhaps is not perfectly exact.
But the picture of the man aground on the rocks with the high crag above
him is easily understood.

νη. discentem, Vergilian variation for ‘striving'‚ and more expres-
sive. There is even a certain grim approach to humour about it, a
quality which we notice elsewhere in this book, 181, 357.

224: consequitur, ‘overtakes'.

Notice the abrupt change of subject in cedit, where however the sense
is not doubtful.

22 5. ‘And now alone is left Cloanthus, close on the goal'.

228. studiis, ‘with cheers' he means: the word properly meaning
‘party-zeal'‚ and so suggesting the excitement of the spectators at a
good tace.

229—30. ‘ These brook not to lose [are indignant if they should not
keep] an honour won and prize already theirs‚ and are fain to barter very
life for victory: Those their good fortune cheers: their hope becomes
their power '. Very terse and forcible lines.

2 30. vitamque... pacisci, in xii. 49 we have letumque sinas pro laude
pacisci the opposite view of the same idea. Pacisci means ‘to bargain’,
and the bargain can be regarded as an exchange of li e for honour, or
death sor honour.

233. ponto, ‘towards the sea’, dative, according to Vergil's constant
use, where in prose would have been used the acc. with prep. See 88.

utrasque, plur. by a poetic stretch of usage for sing. So utraque
tempora, 855.

²34· in vota vocare. A Vergilian variation for ‘invoke with prayers’.

235. aequora curro, ‘o’er whose waters Ι fly’, aec. of extent which
Vergil is rather fond of using with verbs of motion. So maria omnia
ve tz' i. 524, znnare paludem vi. 369.

237. voli reus, technical phrase, ‘bound to my vow’, i. e. bound to
fulfilment.

The gen. is respect.

240. Nereides, the sea· nymphs, daughters of the sea· god Nereus.

Phorcus, a son os Pontus and Terra, a sea· god.

Panopea, one of the Nereids.

²4¹· Portunus, a Roman sea· -g0‚d originally, no doubt, ‘the god of
Harbourage’, named with the Roman unimaginative directness; but
when the rich Greek mythology was adopted by Rome, and the identi-
fication of Gods began to take place, Portunus was identified with the
Greek Melicerta. See Ovid Fast. VI. 547, where the story of Melicerta
is told at length.
