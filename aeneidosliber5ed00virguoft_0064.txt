60 VERGIL. AEN. V.

407. ‘The weight and the huge coils themselves of the thongs'‚ a
hlighly ,elaborated or artificial phrase sor ‘the huge and heavy coiled
tion s .

4g10. caestus et arma, hendiadys, 259 the second word being more
general than the first.

411. ‘The fatal battle', so called because Aeneas' half-brother
Eryx was slain by Hercules.

414. Alciden, common poetic name sor Hercules, since Alcaeus
was father of Amphitryon, whose wife was Alcmene mother of Her-
cules.

414- his ego suetus, ‘to these 1 was inured', his being dat. This
is less harsh than keeping Itis abl. instr. like the first one, and sup-

lying verbs.
p 418. probat auctor Acestes, generally taken to mean, ‘Acestes my
supportet sanctioris', but it is better to take auctor predicate (as in 17,
luppiter auctor spondeat), ‘if the word os Acestes approves’, (lit. if
A. sanctions wz'tlz his authority, as a backer or supporter.)

422. This almost overloaded line is meant to impress the reader
with an idea os the big-boned, brawny warrior.

The extra syllable in lacertosque cut off before exuit adds to the
lumbem'ng effect. ’

425. For constr. of the verb, see 403.

426. in digitos arrectus, ‘on tiptoe' each arose and stood.

4²9· inmiscentque manus manibus, ⁸ and mingle their hands', i.e.
‘spar with their hands‘.

pugnam lacessunt, ‘provoke the fight’‚ rather unusual phrase, but
obvious meaning.

430. pedum motu plainly describes his agility, as opposed to the
other's solid weight. (C.'s notion of ‘tripping up' is inappropriate.)

fretus iuventa, ‘strong in his youth', fre-tus connected with fre-
num, fir-‘mus‚ser-0x‚ &c-

432· genua, scanned as two syllables (gen-ua): so paniete, ariete,
tenuia are dactyls in V.

434. pectore vastos dant sonitus: the nom. to Ingeminant, and
therefore to dant, is probably viri, or else the line would be very harsh
in its connexion with 433. That being so, the phrase must mean ‘they
deal heavy blows on their breasts’, which is certainly a strained use os
lan ua e.

ΕΠ {tulta be taken nom. to ingeminant to avoid this, it will be:
‘ many blows rain on their hollow flank, many resound on their breast':
a rather easier structure, though probably Vergil meant the other:
especially as he uses ingeminant again transitive 457.

In either case pectore is local abl.

437. ‘ Heavy and unmoved stands Entellus in one set strain’.
nisus (a bold word aster V.'s manner) describing the fixed strain of the
muscles in the firmly planted attitude.

438. corpore, i.e. by moving his body without moving his feet: ‘by
nimble turn ’. The comm. quote Cic. (Cat. 1. 6) ¹ Tuas petitiones
parva declinatione, et, ut aiunt, corpore efl‘ugi'.
