(4) Line 273 the disabled boat like a disabled snake.

(5) ,‚ 439 the boxer Dares attacks Entellus with as many
futile onslaughts as a besieger a strong fort.

(6) ,‚ 448 Entellus falls like a hollow pine-trunk.
(7) ‚‚ 458 Entellus blows rain as thick as pelting hail.

(8) ‚‚ 527 a burning arrow like a shooting-star.

(9) ,‚ 588 the evolutions of the boyish troop like the mazy
windings of the Labyrinth in Crete.

(10) ‚, 593 the boys with their quick bright movements like
dolphins.

In studying these similes, we see at once what they add to
the poem in the way of ornament and of picturesque suggestive-
ncss. Thus in (3) the picture of the startled dove fluttering at
first, then sailing with unmoved wings through the liquid air,
is very beautiful: the description of the disabled snake is ex-

is an ornament rather than a true illustration- The art is
shcwn not so much in the choice of the comparison‚ as in the
expression and workmanship: in the vividness of the picture,
the beauty of the language, ancl the truth of the details.

And we must also observe that these details, where they are

(2), (6), (7) they are not given: such similes are barely more
than metaphorS. llut take sor example (3) and (8), which are
