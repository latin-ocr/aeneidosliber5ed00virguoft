Outline of Vergil's life.

P. Vergilius Maro was born 15 Oct., B.C. 70, near Mantua,
a town on the Mincio in North Italy, then called Cisalpine
Gaul. He had not good health, and after being educated at
Cremona and Mediolanum (Milan), and studying Greek and phi-
losophy elsewhere, he came back to live (probably) on his father's
farm, until about Β. C. 42. In that year Octavianus, afterwards
¹the emperor Augustus, had defeated at Philippi Brutus and
Cassius, the murderers of Julius Caesar3 and gave lands to his
victorious soldiers in various parts of Italy, amongst other
assignments being Vergil's sarm. The poet’s first acquaintance
with Augustus was due to this event; for he applied to him at
Rome for the restitution of his property, and was successful.
He became the friend of the rich art-patron Maecenas, the
poet Horace, and the brilliant circle of literary men who were
collected at the court of Augustus. The works of Vergil are

not voluminous. The Eclogues are Idylls in imitation of the
Greek poet Theocritus, and were written sometime before he

was 33. The Georgics‚ an agricultural poem in four books,
of which the form was more or less suggested by Hesiod, he
wrote in the next few years, finishing them sometime about
his 4oth year. The Aeneid, his great work, he appears to
have begun about Β. C. 27, when he was 43 years of age, at
the wish of Augustus. A few years later, finding his health
failing, he tried travelling3 and in the spring of 19 he was at
Athens. The summer he spent with Augustus abroad, but died
a few days after reaching Brundusium on his return. The day
of his death was Sept. 22, and he was not quite 51. He was
buried at Naples, where his tomb is still shewn‚ though the
authenticity of it is at least doubtful.

His character seems to have been most simple, pure, and

loveable; and his poetic fame was well established even before
his death.
