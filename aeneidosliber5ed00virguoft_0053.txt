NOTES. 49

The poet uses septem and the distributive septena indifferently, sor
variety: so 120, 560, trcs...ternique. 96, binas.

87. ‘And glittering flecks of gold kindled his scales'. The literal
expression, ‘And spotty brightness kindled his scale with gold’, is a
very Vergilian inversion of phrase.

88. nubibus. Vergilian dat. of recipIent after iacit, where in prose
would have been a preposition: ‘over the clouds '. So proiecit fluvio,
truncum reliquit arenae, {gnatae linquere terrae.

90. agmine, ‘train’‚ expressive word: certainly more likely than
the meaning impetu which Servius gives it. See note on 21 r.

91. tandem expresses the slow motion (C.).

92. libavitque dapes, ‘and licked the offerings'. It is quite cha-
racteristic of Vergil that this is the first mention of the dapes.

94. instauro, frequently used of renewz'ng or resuming an interrupted
servlce.

95. Genium. All living things, and even places, were supposed to
have representative spirits, as it were abstract essences of the life or the
place, which were divine, and were the object of special worship.
Several Roman phrases arose srom this belief. Indulgere geum meant
‘to enjoy oneself'. Lectus genialis was ‘the bridal bed ', as genius the
life spirit presided over birth.

The Genius of a place was often supposed to appear in the form osa
serpent: and the belief that divine personages had animals as their
attendants (famulumne parentis) was common.

96. binas for duo, see 85.

97. nzssgrantes: offerings to the Lower Powers were black: the
Affanes have black sheep, VI. 15 3: Tempest the sanie, 111. 119: Nzgrlzt a
black lamb, VI. 250. So fflcate, Vl. 247.

99. ‘Shades released from Acheron’ to answer his summotis, and
taste the feast. (Acheron, properly a river of Hades, here as often used
for the Lower World: so in the famous line ‘Flectere si nequeo superos,
Acheronta movebo’, Vll. 312.)

100. quae cuique est copia (grammatically an attraction of copia into
nom.), ‘each from his store’.

103. viscera, ‘the flesh’, its common usage.

[104—123. The games: first the boat-race, with the names of the
ships and captains that compete]

105. Phaethon, originally ‘the shiner'‚ i.e. the sun. In the later
story he was the son of Sol, who rashly drove his father's chariot.

109. The prizes are placed in the midst of the ‘course ', i.e. the
field which was afterwards the course, where the crowd naturally
assembles.

112. talenta seems the more natural reading here: though three
good MSS. read talentum, ‘a talent of gold and silver’ (each). It does
not matter much.

1 ¹3· canit commissos ludos, ‘sounds the opening of the games'.

114. pares, ‘well matched‘: we need not surely find any difficulty
in the fact that he afterwards calls one boat ‘swift' and another ‘huge’.

116. Pristis, ‘Sea-monster’‚ was a large fish, and so a natural sign
and name sor a ship.
