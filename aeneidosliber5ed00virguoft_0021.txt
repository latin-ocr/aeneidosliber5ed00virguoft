In these none but the commonest words are used, and yet
the poetical ffctz'veuess of the style is consummate. Now take
as an example of the elaborate style Hamlet's exclamation to

the Ghost:

“ but tell

Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerementS.’'

Or this from Rz'chard IL:

“Ere my tongue
Shallwound my honour with such feeble wrong
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear‚'’ &c.

In these the strength of feeling finds expression in the very
strangeness of the language.

These instances will illustrate one form of the contrast
between the two styles; and there are many other forms.
Shakespeare will supply many illustrations of both: being a
dramatist and a genius, he speaks in many voices. So do
many if not most poets of the first rank. Wordsworth however
is a notable instance of the simplest style: Pindar perhaps the
best of the elaborate style. The poets of this century in
England‚ feeling as they did the strength of a reaction against
the artificial style of Pope and his followers, produced many
examples besides Wordsworth of the simple style, such as
Moore, Southey, Campbell, much of Byron and Coleridge and
the whole of Walter Scott. Two of the greatest however,
Keats and Shelley, from the gorgeous imagination of the one
and the profound inspiration of the other, supply more examples
of the elaborate and forcible style.

Now Vergil’s poetry belongs largely to this second class. It
is true that he can be simple, and osten is : he is much too great
an artist to ignore any poetic resource. But for the most part
he does not aim at expressing his thoughts in the simplest, but
rather in the most striking manner. He often employs ‘an
elaboration of language which disdains or is unable to say a
