46 VERGIL. AEN. V.

15. colligere arma, ‘gather all the tackle in' (M), i.e. ‘make all
trim'‚ as usual when a storm is coming. It need not be confined to
‘furling sails’, though that is no doubt a main part. [C.'s suggestion,
that it is perhaps metaphorieal, is not happy]

validis incumbere remis, ‘ bend to the strong oar,' a perfectly intelli-
gible expression, though it is really the rower who is validus, and the
epithet is transferred.

17. si Iuppiter auctor spondeat: auctor is predicative3 lit. ‘ if Jove
promised, backing the promise’, ‘ if Jove’s word were my warrant'.

18. sperem contingere, ‘ hope to reach’, poet. use of pres. inf.

19—20. In the grand manner of Vergil: ‘the winds are changed:
{gogictllgtzgslack west they rise and roar athwart uS, and the air gathers

21. tendere tantum sufficimus, ‘ have strength for such an effort'.

The poet is not quite consistent in his details: they start with
‘savouring zephyrs’, 1v. 563: they sail ‘steadfastly'‚ though the norm
wind blackens the waves, v. 2: and now they abandon the voyage as
the wind shists to west. We must not take the poet too strictly. They
are sailing steadily‚ when a storm drives them ashore: and Aeneas has
no sooner pointed out that it is their fate to land, when the threatened
storm (lo—20) again becomes a ‘ savouring zephyr’.

²4· ‘ Fraternal shores of Eryx’, because Eryx was son of Venus
and Butes, Aeneas son of Venus and Anchises. Eryx is supposed
founder of the town of that name on W. coast of Sicily, near the moun-
tain also called Eryx, 759.

Sicanos, ‘Sicilian': according to Thucydides (VI. α) different from
the Siculi, being two raees immigrating at different times; but the
Latin poets identify them, and use the two names as convertible.

2 5. Observe the accumulated expression, in the poet's manner.
‘Is duly Ι remember and retrace the stars 1 watched of old'.

28. flecte viam velis, ⁴ shift sail and go about' (M).

²9· ‘ Or one whither I would rather steer my weary ships’. optem
subj. aster quo consecutive: ‘ any land such that thither, &c.'

31. In 1v. 710 Anchises is said to have died at ‘the harbour of
Drepanum', the last place in Sicily where Aeneas touched before ‘the
god drove him to the shores of Asrica'.

33. ‘The fleet rides swiftly o’er the billow’, and all is now joy
and hope again.

[3 5—71. Acestes hospitably receives him: and Aeneas finding it is
the day of his father Anchises’ funeral, proclaims a festival and games
m h3187.h01‘¹?h1r's]avage guise with javelins and Asric's bear-skin'. [Pliny
says there were no bears in Africa: Herodotus, Martial, Vergil and
Juvenal all speak of them]

,in iacchz's, slight but natural variation for the more usual abl. inst.
astcggn ajjcestes was related to be son of a Trojan maiden Egesta and
the Sicilian river-god Crimisus. There is a slight strangeness in the
